    <p class="Instructions">How to roast a whole chicken</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the rub. Form a paste with the minced garlic and salt by mashing it together on a cutting board.
            It might get a little messy, but it is totally worth it! Combine the paste in a small bowl with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, lemon zest, Italian seasoning, and black pepper. </li>
        <li>Dry the chicken. Use paper towels to pat the chicken dry inside and out, removing as much moisture as you possibly can.
            Do not be afraid to get up close and personal with the chicken! Removing moisture helps achieve that beautiful, golden, crispy skin</li>
        <li>Season the chicken. Place the chicken on a large plate, and loosen the skin from the breast meat and legs. Divide the Italian seasoning rub into thirds.
            Then rub it on the flesh, skin, and inside the cavity of the chicken. Then, stuff the chicken with the rest of the lemon and the quartered onion.</li>
        <li>Truss the chicken. Truss the chicken by tucking the wings under the bird. Then, wrap twine under and around the chicken, crossing it over the breast like an X and tying the legs together.
            If you are short on time, skipping this step is not the end of the world, but it does help the roasted whole chicken cook more evenly!</li>
        <li>Air dry the chicken. Store the chicken, uncovered, in the fridge for 24 hours.This removes additional moisture from the skin making it extra crispy, while giving the salt a chance to impact the protein in the flesh leaving the chicken meat succulent.
            However, if it is Tuesday night and you forget about dry brining your chicken, you can skip this step. Just coat the chicken flesh and skin with the rub, and pop it in the oven instead. It will still taste delicous.</li>
        <li>Revive the chicken. Your chicken will look a little emaciated the next day when you remove it from the fridge, but stick with me here.
            You did not do anything wrong! In fact, you did everything right. Simply rub it with more olive oil, salt, and Italian seasoning, and it will liven right up!</li>
        <li>Roast. Transfer the whole chicken to a cast iron skillet, and let it roast in the oven until an instant-read thermometer reads 165Â°F when inserted into the thickest part of the breast.
            Once fully cooked, allow the chicken to rest for 5-10 minutes, and dig in!</li>
